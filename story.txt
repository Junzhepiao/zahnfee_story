There was once a man from Raesfeld.
He had a lovely Hund named Bob.
Bob loved to eat Bratwurst on the couch
While listening to Musik by Rammstein.
For dessert he liked to have a piece of Brot.
He thought the Baeckerei was quite nice.
Bob also likes to visit the Biergarten in the evenings.
The man wore a Dirndl while watching Bob eat.
